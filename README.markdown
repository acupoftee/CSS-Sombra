# Initiating the Hack (Pure CSS Sombra)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/cybercountess/pen/PoPPZGe](https://codepen.io/cybercountess/pen/PoPPZGe).

Here's a pure CSS animation of Sombra from Overwatch! I enjoyed this project since I applied new illustration techniques using clip-path, and skew(). the more I worked on this animation, the more I realized that I learn so much more about CSS and it's potential through animation. 

Also, Sombra's my favorite hero from Overwatch. It's insane how similar her and I are.  I also love sneaking up on people and tilting the enemy team with her :P If anyone here is interested in Overwatch, hopefully we can play together someday!
